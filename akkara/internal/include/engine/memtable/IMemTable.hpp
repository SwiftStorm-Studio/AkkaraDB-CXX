     *
     * Supported responsibilities:
     * - append-style writes with sequence numbers
     * - snapshot-aware point lookup
     * - ordered iteration for flush and scans
     * - immutable freeze before SST flush
     *
     * Intended backend implementations include:
     * - Skip List
     * - BPTree
     * - Red-Black Tree
     *
     * Design constraints:
     * - ordered traversal is mandatory
     * - multi-version records are backend-managed
     * - tombstones are represented via record flags
