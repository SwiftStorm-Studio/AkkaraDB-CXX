    /**
     * @brief Owning byte buffer with customizable deallocation strategy.
     *
     * OwnedBuffer represents a contiguous memory region with exclusive ownership.
     * It is a move-only type that releases its memory using a user-provided
     * deleter function when destroyed.
     *
     * Design principles:
     * - Exclusive ownership (move-only, no copying)
     * - Pluggable deallocation strategy (heap / pool / arena / custom)
     * - Zero-overhead abstraction (no virtual dispatch, no heap for control block)
     * - Interoperable with BufferView (non-owning view)
     *
     * Lifetime model:
     * - The buffer is released when the OwnedBuffer is destroyed
     * - The release mechanism depends on the configured deleter
     *
     * Example:
     * @code
     * auto buf = OwnedBuffer::allocate(1024); // heap allocation
     * auto view = buf.as_view();              // non-owning view
     * @endcode
     *
     * Custom allocator example (pool):
     * @code
     * auto buf = OwnedBuffer(ptr, size, pool_deleter, pool_ptr);
     * @endcode
     *
     * Thread-safety:
     * - Not thread-safe for concurrent mutation
     * - Safe to move across threads
